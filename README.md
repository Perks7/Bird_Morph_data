## Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America

Abstract--The Atlantic Forest is one of the most vibrant ecosystems in South America. It lies on Brazilâ€™s east coast reaching from Argentina to Paraguay, and it is known for housing one of the most diverse bird populations in the world. 
Along with diverse bird populations, The Atlantic Forest also has varied topography and altitude. We want to know, is there a correlation between altitude and ratio of mass to length of birds in The Atlantic Forest? To answer this question, we will be using the Atlantic Bird Traits data set. This data set has been compiled over two centuries (1820-2018) and includes data on 80% of the bird populations found in The Atlantic Forest. We will perform an exploratory analysis on this data set looking for correlations between altitude and ratio of mass to length of bird species. Based on other similar analyses, we expect to see a positive correlation between these variables.
